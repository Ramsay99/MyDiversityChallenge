Calculates the diversity of a string.

I stumbled on a difficult problem that I couldn't easily solve on paper.
However, I learned the pattern and devised the rule to get the solution.

The main method Desc:
    /**
     * Calculates the diversity of a string.
     *
     * @param str the input string
     * @return the diversity of the string
     * @throws BelowZeroException if the factorial calculation encounters a negative number
     */

Recognizing that I utilized ChatGPT as a support tool to ensure that my code reached its highest potential.
